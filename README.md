# DFS-Shortest-Path-Visualizer

A visual and interactive implementation of a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** based algorithm to find the **minimum cost path** in a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**.

This tool helps understand how recursive DFS can be used to explore all paths and compute the shortest-cost route — with a clear, real-time graph visualization.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Summary

This tool uses a **recursive DFS approach** to find the path with the **minimum total cost** from a given node by exploring all possible child paths and comparing costs.
